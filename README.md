👋 Hi, I´m Mariano Bermúdez.

🎓 I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at F.C.E.F.N in San Juan, Argentina

💻 I´ve a keen interest in data science and artificial intelligence.

🚀 I'm on a journey to merge my theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, and I'm currently seeking opportunities as an entry-level/junior Data Scientist to immerse myself in real-world projects.

🛠️ Explore my GitHub portfolio to witness my coding projects, where I've applied algorithms, tackled data challenges, and delved into the world of intelligent systems. From predictive modeling to deep learning, I'm eager to contribute and learn in the dynamic field of technology.

🌐 Let's connect and collaborate on innovative projects. Excited to learn and contribute to data-driven solutions.
